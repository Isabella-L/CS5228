    "\n",
    "Hello everyone, this assignment notebook covers Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Clustering. There are some code-completion tasks and question-answering tasks in this answer sheet. For code completion tasks, please write down your answer (i.e., your lines of code) between sentences \"Your code starts here\" and \"Your code ends here\". The space between these two lines does not reflect the required or expected lines of code. For answers in plain text, you can refer to [this Markdown guide](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd) to customize the layout (although it shouldn't be needed).\n",

    "When you work on this notebook, you can insert additional code cells (e.g., for testing) or markdown cells (e.g., to keep track of your thoughts). However, before the submission, please remove all those additional cells again. Thanks!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** \n",
    "* Remember to rename and save this Jupyter notebook as **A1_YourName_YourNUSNETID.ipynb** (e.g., **A1_BobSmith_e12345678.ipynb**) before submission!\n",
    "* Remember to rename and save the Python script file **A1_YourName_YourNUSNETID.py** (e.g., **A1_BobSmith_e12345678.py**) before submission!\n",
    "* Submission deadline is **Sep 18, 11.59 pm**. Late submissions will be penalized by 10% for each additional day. There is no need to use your full name if it's rather long; it's just important to easily identify you in Canvas etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also add your NUSNET and student id in the code cell below. This is just to make any identification of your notebook doubly sure."

    "The dataset may contain **extreme outliers** in numerical attributes such as mileage and price. For example, one accord sports car shows a mileage of 38600 km, which is unusually high compared to most records. Such values can dominate regression coefficients and reduce model accuracy. To identify outliers, boxplots can be used. Clear anomalies and cap values should be removed. \n",

    "Market conditions that change over time and can introduce **temporal noise**. For example, a car manufactured in 2011 with a registration date in 2012 will have a very different price trend compared to one manufactured in 2011 but registered in 2021. Mixing such records without considering time effects introduces temporal noise. This can be identified by comparing manufactured with reg_date, or analyzing resale price trends by year. To handle this issue, either restrict the dataset to a consistent time window or create new features such as “car age” or “listing year” to explicitly account for temporal effects.\n"

Regarding encoding techniques, we covered [One-Hot Encoding](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) in the lecture, and also talked about [Target Encoding](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/targetencoder.html) in the tutorial; you can and should also look into other encoding techniques.\n",

    "### 2.1 Implementing DBSCAN for Noise Detection (8 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we covered the original algorithm of DBSCAN, which you can also find on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN). While not difficult to implement, it takes quite a couple of lines of codes to do so. For this assignment, however, we are only interested in the points of a dataset that DBSCAN considers noise (as illustrated below; the red dots in the next plot). This includes that we do not have to care about\n",
    "\n",
    "* how many clusters there are (the plot below hints at 3 clusters but it does not matter) *and*\n",
    "* which non-noise points (the grey dots in the plot below) belong to which cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task is to implement a modified/simplified version of DBSCAN to find all noise points in a dataset!** The skeleton of method `get_noise_dbscan()` you need to complete is found in the file `A2.py` (before the appropriate renaming). The method takes data matrix `X` as well as the two basic parameters `eps` and `min_samples` as input parameters; we use the same naming as scikit-learn's implementation of [DBSCAN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html).  The output should be 2 lists of indices: (a) one containing the indices of all *core points* and (b) one containing the indices of all *noise points* in input dataset X.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**\n",
    "* We only split this task into 2.1 a) and 2.1 b) to have intermediate results you can check for correctness (and potentially to better allow for partial marking). Our reference solutions first finds all core points and uses this information to find all noise points; hence the 2 separate code blocks for you to complete.\n",
    "* However, if you have a better/faster/shorter/cooler/etc. solution, you are more than welcome to implement it and ignore the intermediate result of finding all core points. Only the result from 2.1 b) is important. This also means that you can ignore 2.1 a) and still get full marks if you correctly identify all noise points.\n",
    "* If you have an alternative solution, please make sure that the method still returns the 2 output parameters `(core_point_indices, noise_point_indices)`. If you do not need to explicitly identify the core points, you can simply return `None` for `core_point_indices`.\n",
    "* You can import any method `numpy`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, or `pandas` has to offer -- except for any ready-made implementation of DBSCAN, of course :). Please add any imports to the code cell at the top with the other imports. Hint: We already imported [`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances.html) for you.\n",

In practice, we would likely remove those noise points, treat them separately, or maybe perform additional preprocessing steps to potentially \"denoise\" the dataset. However, the steps of choice generally depend heavily on the exact data mining task. Here, we focus on the identification of noise points."

    "Yes, in principle we can use other distance metrics such as Manhattan or Minkowski in place of Euclidean distance in Lloyd’s algorithm, because the algorithm only requires a way to measure distances between points and centroids. However, the choice of metric affects both the geometry of the clusters and the centroid update rule. Euclidean is most common because the mean is the exact minimizer of squared Euclidean distances, which makes the algorithm simple and efficient.\n",
    "If we switch to Manhattan distance, the median becomes the better representative. This leads to variants such as K-Medians. Similarly, with general Minkowski distances, the definition of the centroid may need to be adapted. These alternatives are useful when the data lie on grids, when different axes have more importance, or when robustness to outliers is required since Manhattan is less sensitive to extreme values compared to Euclidean. Those metrics can be used, but only if we also adjust the centroid calculation to match, and the results will differ depending on the data characteristics and the goals of clustering"
