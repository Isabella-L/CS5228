    "\n",
    "Hello everyone, this assignment notebook covers Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Clustering. There are some code-completion tasks and question-answering tasks in this answer sheet. For code completion tasks, please write down your answer (i.e., your lines of code) between sentences \"Your code starts here\" and \"Your code ends here\". The space between these two lines does not reflect the required or expected lines of code. For answers in plain text, you can refer to [this Markdown guide](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd) to customize the layout (although it shouldn't be needed).\n",

    "When you work on this notebook, you can insert additional code cells (e.g., for testing) or markdown cells (e.g., to keep track of your thoughts). However, before the submission, please remove all those additional cells again. Thanks!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** \n",
    "* Remember to rename and save this Jupyter notebook as **A1_YourName_YourNUSNETID.ipynb** (e.g., **A1_BobSmith_e12345678.ipynb**) before submission!\n",
    "* Remember to rename and save the Python script file **A1_YourName_YourNUSNETID.py** (e.g., **A1_BobSmith_e12345678.py**) before submission!\n",
    "* Submission deadline is **Sep 18, 11.59 pm**. Late submissions will be penalized by 10% for each additional day. There is no need to use your full name if it's rather long; it's just important to easily identify you in Canvas etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also add your NUSNET and student id in the code cell below. This is just to make any identification of your notebook doubly sure."

    "In the lecture, we covered the original algorithm of DBSCAN, which you can also find on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN). While not difficult to implement, it takes quite a couple of lines of codes to do so. For this assignment, however, we are only interested in the points of a dataset that DBSCAN considers noise (as illustrated below; the red dots in the next plot). This includes that we do not have to care about\n",

    "**Your task is to implement a modified/simplified version of DBSCAN to find all noise points in a dataset!** The skeleton of method `get_noise_dbscan()` you need to complete is found in the file `A2.py` (before the appropriate renaming). The method takes data matrix `X` as well as the two basic parameters `eps` and `min_samples` as input parameters; we use the same naming as scikit-learn's implementation of [DBSCAN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html).  The output should be 2 lists of indices: (a) one containing the indices of all *core points* and (b) one containing the indices of all *noise points* in input dataset X.\n",

    "**Important:**\n",
    "* We only split this task into 2.1 a) and 2.1 b) to have intermediate results you can check for correctness (and potentially to better allow for partial marking). Our reference solutions first finds all core points and uses this information to find all noise points; hence the 2 separate code blocks for you to complete.\n",
    "* However, if you have a better/faster/shorter/cooler/etc. solution, you are more than welcome to implement it and ignore the intermediate result of finding all core points. Only the result from 2.1 b) is important. This also means that you can ignore 2.1 a) and still get full marks if you correctly identify all noise points.\n",
    "* If you have an alternative solution, please make sure that the method still returns the 2 output parameters `(core_point_indices, noise_point_indices)`. If you do not need to explicitly identify the core points, you can simply return `None` for `core_point_indices`.\n",

    "Assume you have a dataset `X`, run DBSCAN, and get a clustering that contains a set of clusters and some noise points (there's no need to be more precise; it's only important that you don't get just noise). Let's also assume you create a new dataset `X_new` simply by shuffling `X` (i.e., randomly change the order of data points in the dataset); no other changes. Now you run DBSCAN with the *same* parameters as before over `X_new` and get a different clustering, i.e., most of the clusters are not exactly the same as before.\n",

    "In the lecture, we used the Euclidean Distance between data points in centroids to perform the Lloyd's algorithm. However, there are other distance metrics such as the [Manhatten Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) or the [Minkowski Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_distance). Can we use those or similar metrics instead of the Euclidean Distance? Give a **brief** justification for your answer!\n",
